What does our backend need to support?
It should provide a way to

1. List the summary of all the tasks.

GET /todos

2. Get the details for a single ask by ID
GET /todos/:id


3. Update  a single task
{ 
    task: "...",
    description: "...",
    done: true/false
}

4. Delete a single task, if I have the id
    - id should be immutable (cannot be changed)
    - id should be unique

5. Add a single task
POST /todos
{
    task: "...",
    description: "...."
}


What information do I want to hold
task (string)
number/id (number)
description (string)
done (boolean)
